## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that code or software is functional through testing. Testing will provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of my system, and establishes whether this system does what it is intended to do.
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs can be interpreted by listening to user stories and then analyzing what the user wants. Most of the time, the user does not really know what they want. This creates ambiguity. Ultimately, most users cannot possibly envision the overall functionality of the system. 
## How do I approach designing software?
After collecting the user requirements and devloping a generalized overview of the user needs and perspective of the system, I start designing the system. This stresses the need for having a sound requirement methodology. Three common design levels result in highly optimized systems, and those include architectural, high-level, and detailed designs.
